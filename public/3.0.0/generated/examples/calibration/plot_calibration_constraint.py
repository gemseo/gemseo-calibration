# %%
# Let us consider a function $f(x)=[ax,bx]$
# from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$:
model = AnalyticDiscipline({"y": "a*x", "z": "b*x"}, name="model")

# %%
# This is a model of our reference data source,
# which a kind of oracle providing input-output data
# without the mathematical relationship behind it:
reference = AnalyticDiscipline({"y": "2*x", "z": "3*x"}, name="reference")

# %%
# However in this pedagogical example,
# the mathematical relationship is known, and we can see that
# the parameters $a$ and $b$ must be equal to 2 and 3 respectively
# so that the model and the reference are identical.
#
# In the following,
# we will try to find these values from several information sources.

# %%
# Firstly,
# we have prior knowledge of the parameter values, that is $[a,b]\in[0,10]^2$:
prior = ParameterSpace()
prior.add_variable("a", lower_bound=0.0, upper_bound=10.0, value=0.0)
prior.add_variable("b", lower_bound=0.0, upper_bound=10.0, value=0.0)

# %%
# Secondly,
# given an input space $[0.,3.]$:
input_space = DesignSpace()
input_space.add_variable("x", lower_bound=0.0, upper_bound=3.0)

# %%
# we generate reference output data by sampling the reference discipline:
reference_dataset = sample_disciplines(
    [reference],
    input_space,
    ["y", "z"],
    algo_name="CustomDOE",
    samples=array([[1.0], [2.0]]),
)
reference_data = reference_dataset.to_dict_of_arrays(False)

# %%
# From these information sources,
# we can build and execute a
# [CalibrationScenario][gemseo_calibration.scenario.CalibrationScenario]
# to find the value of the parameters $a$ and $b$
# which minimizes a
# [CalibrationMeasure][gemseo_calibration.measure.CalibrationMeasure]
# related to the output $y$ with
# a constraint about a
# [CalibrationMeasure][gemseo_calibration.measure.CalibrationMeasure]
# related to the output $z$.
calibration = CalibrationScenario(model, "x", CalibrationMeasure("y", "MSE"), prior)
calibration.add_constraint(CalibrationMeasure("z", "MSE"))
calibration.execute(
    algo_name="NLOPT_COBYLA", reference_data=reference_data, max_iter=100
)

# %%
# Lastly,
# we get the calibrated parameters:
calibration.optimization_result.x_opt

# %%
# plot an optimization history view:
calibration.post_process(post_name="OptHistoryView", save=False, show=True)

# %%
# as well as the model data versus the reference ones,
# before and after the calibration:
calibration.post_process(post_name="DataVersusModel", output="z", save=False, show=True)
